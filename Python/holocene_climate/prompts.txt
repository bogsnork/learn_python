Context: folder of spatial raster files (geotiff) hosted in a public S3 bucket at s3://chelsav1/chelsa_trace/pr/.  Each file covers the entire globe and cell size is 100m.   Each file uses about 80Mb of disk space.  The attached context file chelsa-trace21k_technical_documentation.pdf describes the data in more detail.  Focus in particular on file naming, and table4 (which describes the timeID variable).  For the present we are only interested in precipitation (variable pr).  
Objective:  A python script which extracts the area of a bounding box covering Britain and Ireland from one or more of the remote geotiffs and saves them to a new local geotiff named "data/CHELSA_TraCE21k_UK_V1.0_[currentdatetime].tif" with a new band for each extract (representing a unique month and timeID).   
Further specifications: The new geotiff should be saved as cloud optimised geotiff. The new bands should be identified by the middle part of the original filename identifying month ("m") and timeID ("c") (i.e. the band containing the extract from CHELSA_TraCE21k_pr_12_10_V1.0.tif should be named "m12_c10". Note that timeID can be negative so CHELSA_TraCE21k_pr_12_-10_V1.0.tif should be named "m12_c-10".)
Suggestions: use GDAL and geopandas if appropriate.
